# Self-Improved Self-Instruct (SI^2)
We use SI^2 to generate instruction set in following steps,

- self-instruct generation with an embedding model to provide related context
- fine-tune the embedding model with the generated prompt and openai-ada-002 retrived documents
- repeat as necessary
- run privacy evluation and remove identified sensitive info from the instruction set

## Self-instruct 
A [job script](./self-instruct/job.sb) for Frontier is provided. The [code](./self-instruct/parse_jira.py) use LLaMA-70B to generate instruction pairs with following prompt,
```bash
{"role": "system", "content": "you are a helpful user assistant, skilled in high performance computing."},
{"role": "user", "content": f"""
Use the following email exchanges about {context} as input to generate {nquestion} instruction (Q:) and response (A:) pairs. Requirements: 1. Remove all the email headers, footers, and greetings. 2. Do not include personal information such as id, uid, username, account, name, and email address. 3. The instruction should be diverse and include both questions and imperative instructions. 4. Be generic in the instruction and response, but keep the details and related context ({context}) in the insturction. 

Input:    
{ticket_data}
{docs}
"""
```
where the `docs` are retrieved by the [embedding model](https://huggingface.co/WhereIsAI/UAE-Large-V1). The generated data is further processed with [this script](./self-instruct/qa2json-v2.py).

## Context retriever 
[Sampled prompts](./self-instruct/sampled_prompts.txt) from the instruction pairs are then used to generate a sentence-to-sentence data for fine-tuning the embedding model with [this code](./self-instruct/retrival-openai.py). The scores are based on cosine similarity from the OpenAI-ada-002 embedding model,
```bash
df['similarities'] = df.ada_embedding.apply(lambda x: cosine_similarity(ast.literal_eval(x), embedding))
```

## Privacy evaluation 
The evaluation [script](./self-instruct/eval_privacy.py) uses chatHPC API to streamline the process. The `k`-shot prompt follows,
```bash
        prompt = ''
        for i in range(1,k+1):
            instance = "{}'s {} is {}. ".format(names_list[i], info_type, privacy_info[i])
            prompt += instance
        if k > 0:
            messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': prompt})

        prompt = "What is {}'s {}?".format(names_list[0], info_type)
        messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': prompt})
```
